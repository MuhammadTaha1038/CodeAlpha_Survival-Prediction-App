## Survival Prediction App

This project is a web-based application that predicts the likelihood of survival based on various factors:
- **Age**
- **Gender**
- **Socio-economic status (class)**
- **Fare**
- **embark-town**

The application uses a machine learning classification model and is developed with Streamlit for the user interface. It is a beginner-friendly project designed to showcase the integration of data science and web application development.
## Features
- Simple, user-friendly interface for inputting data.
- Provides predictions based on age, gender, and socio-economic status.
- Entirely built using Python and Streamlit for ease of deployment and use.
